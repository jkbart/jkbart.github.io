# TIOBE Index for February 2024

### February Headline: The Go programming language enters the top 10



This month, Go entered the TIOBE index top 10 at position 8. This is the highest position Go has ever had. When it was launched by Google in November 2009, Go was an instant hit. These were the days that everything that Google did was magic. A few years before Go's appearance, Google released GMail, Google Maps and Google Docs. So when Google announced its first own language, Go, the software community was thrilled. It was the talk of the town. After only 2 months of existence, Go won the TIOBE language of the year award. Unexpectedly, the hype was over soon. In 2015, Go hit position #122 in the TIOBE index and all seemed lost. One year later, Go adopted a very strict "half a year" release cycle (backed up by Google). Every new release, Go improved. In parallel, Docker and Kubernetes (both written in Go) started to become very popular as of 2016. This helped to regain confidence in Go. Nowadays, Go is used in many software fields such as back end programming, web services and APIs. Thanks to its growing adoption in industry, Go seems to be a language that has the capabilities to stay in the TIOBE index top 10 for a long time. Interesting side note: the most recent new language of Google, Carbon, entered the top 100 for the first time this month. -- *Paul Jansen, CEO TIOBE Software* 

The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming 
languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of 
skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sites
Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 other engines are used to calculate the ratings.
It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the *best*  programming language or the language
in which *most lines of code*  have been written.

The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a 
strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new 
software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found .

## This Month's Changes in the Index


This month the following changes have been made to the definition of the index:


- Landerson Gomes dos Santos observed that YouTube and Baidu are not used anymore to calculate the TIOBE index, so we have changed the wording of the introduction to the TIOBE index a bit.

## Very Long Term History



To see the bigger picture, please find below the positions of the top 10 programming languages of many years back. Please note that these are *average*  positions for a period of 12 months.

| Programming Language| 2024| 2019| 2014| 2009| 2004| 1999| 1994| 1989 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:  |
| Python| 1| 4| 8| 6| 11| 27| 22| - |
| C| 2| 2| 1| 2| 2| 1| 1| 1 |
| C++| 3| 3| 4| 3| 3| 2| 2| 3 |
| Java| 4| 1| 2| 1| 1| 13| -| - |
| C#| 5| 6| 5| 8| 8| 30| -| - |
| JavaScript| 6| 8| 9| 9| 9| 20| -| - |
| Visual Basic| 7| 19| -| -| -| -| -| - |
| PHP| 8| 7| 6| 5| 6| -| -| - |
| SQL| 9| 9| -| -| 7| -| -| - |
| Assembly language| 10| 11| -| -| -| -| -| - |
| Objective-C| 27| 10| 3| 38| 48| -| -| - |
| Lisp| 33| 28| 14| 17| 15| 12| 7| 2 |
| (Visual) Basic| -| -| 7| 4| 5| 3| 3| 7 |


There are 2 important remarks here:

- There is a difference between "Visual Basic" and "(Visual) Basic" in the table above. Until 2010, "(Visual) Basic" referred to all possible dialects of Basic, including Visual Basic. After some discussion, it has been decided to split "(Visual) Basic" into all its dialects such as Visual Basic .NET, Classic Visual Basic, PureBasic, and Small Basic, just to name a few. Since Visual Basic .NET has become the major implementation of Visual Basic, it is now called "Visual Basic".
- The programming language SQL was added to the TIOBE index in 2018 after somebody pointed out that SQL is Turing Complete. So although this language is very old, it has only a short history in the index.

## Programming Language Hall of Fame


The hall of fame listing all "Programming Language of the Year" award winners is shown below. The award is given to the programming language that has the highest rise in ratings in a year.

## Bugs & Change Requests


This is the top 5 of most requested changes and bugs. If you have any suggestions how to improve the index donât hesitate to send an e-mail toÂ  [tpci@tiobe.com](https://www.tiobe.com/mailto:tpci@tiobe.com) .

- Apart from â<language> programmingâ, also other queries such as âprogramming with <language>â, â<language> developmentâ and â<language> codingâ should be tried out.
- Add queries for other natural languages (apart from English). The idea is to start with the Chinese search engine Baidu. This has been implemented partially and will be completed the next few months.
- Add a list of all search term requests that have been rejected. This is to minimize the number of recurring mails about Rails, JQuery, JSP, etc.
- Start a TIOBE index for databases, software configuration management systems and application frameworks.
- Some search engines allow to query pages that have been added last year. The TIOBE index should only track those recently added pages.

### Am I allowed to show the TIOBE index in my weblog/presentation/publication?


Yes, the only condition is to refer to its original source âwww.tiobe.comâ.
### How may I nominate a new language to be added to the TIOBE index?


If a language meets the criteria of being listed (i.e. it is Turing complete and has an own Wikipedia entry that indicates that it concerns a programming language) and it is sufficiently popular (more than 5,000 hits for +â<language> programmingâ for Google), then please write an e-mail toÂ  [tpci@tiobe.com](https://www.tiobe.com/mailto:tpci@tiobe.com) .
### I would like to have the complete data set of the TIOBE index. Is this possible?


We spent a lot of effort to obtain all the data and keep the TIOBE index up to date. In order to compensate a bit for this, we ask a fee of 5,000 US$ for the complete data set. The data set runs from June 2001 till today. It started with 25 languages back in 2001, and now measures more than 150 languages once a month. The data are available in comma separated format. Please contactÂ  [sales@tiobe.com](https://www.tiobe.com/mailto:sales@tiobe.com) Â for more information.
### Why is the maximum taken to calculate the ranking for a grouping, why not the sum?


Well, you can do it either way and both are wrong. If you take the sum, then you get the intersection twice. If you take the max, then you miss the difference. Which one to choose? Suppose somebody comes up with a new search term that is 10% of the original. If you take the max, nothing changes. If you take the sum then the ratings will rise 10%. So taking the sum will be an incentive for some to come up with all kinds of obscure terms for a language. Thatâs why we decided to take the max.

The proper way to solve this is is of course to take the sum and subtract the intersection. This will give rise to an explosion of extra queries that must be performed. Suppose a language has a grouping of 15 terms, then you have to perform 32,768 queries (all combinations of intersections). So this seems not possible eitherâ¦ If somebody has a solution for this, please let us know.
