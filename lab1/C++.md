Written by Coursera Staff â¢ Updated on Nov 29, 2023

Discover the programming language C++, what itâs used for, and how to learn it. ![Image is supposed to be here!](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://images.ctfassets.net/wp1lcwdav1p1/2CCM9lMcaLU2igaq8Z6YyS/fc044260d72df535f325d5bf5d707cce/GettyImages-1332378553__1_.jpg?w=1500&h=680&q=60&fit=fill&f=faces&fm=jpg&fl=progressive&auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1&w=1000) 

C++ is among the top 10 most widely used programming languages in the world []. It's a general-purpose programming language (GPL), which means you can use it to build any type of program. The article below further explores the use cases, benefits, and potential drawbacks of C plus-plus. You can use it to determine whether it's the right programming language for you to learn. 
## What is C plus-plus?


C++ (or âC-plus-plusâ) is a generic programming language for building software. Itâs an . In other words, it emphasizes using data fields with unique attributes (a.k.a. objects) rather than logic or functions. A common example of an object is a user account on a website. Typically, a user account contains closely related data like first name, last name, and email address. Bundling this information together into an object makes it easy to replicate the process of creating a new account. 

**Did you know?** 

Bjarne Stroustrup invented C++ in 1979 to extend C, a procedural programming language. It was designed to offer programmers more control over memory and system resources. ![Image is supposed to be here!](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera_assets.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/purple-hash-pattern.svg?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&blur=200&px=8&max-w=252) 
## What is C plus-plus used for?


Over time, C++ has become a choice language for building fast and reliable software. Its versatility makes it an excellent match for complex applications, embedded systems, and  [internet of things (IoT) devices](https://www.coursera.org/articles/internet-of-things) . A few of its most common use cases are as follows:




- 

**Software engineering.** A couple of applications you might use daily that were created with C plus-plus include Netflix and Amazon.




- 

**Operating system (OS) development.** Examples of OS that were created with C++ include Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and iOS.




- 

**Graphical user interfaces.** C++ is often recommended for graphical user interface design or, GUI. Â




- 

**Virtual reality (VR).** C++ can be an excellent language to learn if you want to develop VR applications.




- 

**BlockchainÂ technology.** The well-known cryptocurrency Bitcoin was developed in C++. It can also be used to create smart contracts.


**** 

- 

**Game development.** You can develop games and gaming consoles with C++. For example, the game World of Warcraft and the Xbox console.

## Should you learn C++?


C plus-plus is a great language to learn if you want to gain a deep understanding of how computers work. It's generally considered to be a good starting point for novice or beginner coders. With knowledge of C++, you may also be able to pick up other languages like Python or JavaScript more easily.

### Advantages of learning C++


Programming in C++ offers several advantages. Because it is object oriented, you can easily organize and classify the code. Instead of rewriting code from scratch, you can reuse it. You can also use C plus-plus to interact directly with a computerâs hardware. As a result, you'll be able to control how a system uses its computational resources, like software, hardware, and memory.Â

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)




The time it takes to learn C++ depends on several factors, including the amount of experience you have with programming languages in general, the kind of course you take to learn it, and the amount of time you devote to it on a regular basis. If you are a beginner, expect to spend about two to three months learning the basics and six to 12 months learning to solve complex programming problems. To get a sense of how long it will take you to learn C++, examine the syllabi or content outlines of different C++ courses for beginners and reflect on how much time you can spend every day or week.Â Â 
â

You can learn C++ without the live assistance of an instructor or mentor. That said, you will likely need to find courses, tutorials, and other educational resources to learn concepts and skills in the sequence thatâs most conducive to learning. For extra support, join C++ community forums to ask questions and find solutions to programming challenges.Â 
â

For those new to programming, itâs important to know that C++ syntax is more advanced than other languages. Experience in other programming languages such as C or Python may make it easier to learn C++. At the same time, taking on the challenge of learning C++ first can provide a strong foundation for learning other programming languages.Â
